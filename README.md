# EEA - Extended Eucledian Algorithm

A small C program that calculates, besides the *greates common divisor* of two values, the coefficients of [BÃ©zout's identity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zout%27s_identity) using the [extended Euclidean algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm).

The main intention to write this program was to polish my rusty C skills. If someone has a use for this, even better.
